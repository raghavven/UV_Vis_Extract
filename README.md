# UV_Vis_Extract
This is simple code used to extract the Lambda max from Gaussian TDDFT output file, written in Shell
There are two versions of the code. One which worked in my windows system on WSL platform and another that worked on a HPC cluster.
The codes will output the file name/molecular system name, wavelength of maximum absorption in eV and nm and the oscillator strength
